<h1>Melanix Execute </h1>
A project for interactive live performance. https://flpdigital.com/projects/melanix-execute/

Created for Artist Maril√®ne Oliver and Performer Isabelle Van Grimde using  https://openframeworks.cc (of_prerelease_v007_win_cb).

The project uses the Kinect v2 to track the performaners movement and controlling a collage of overlapping video clips. 
Individual limbs can be assigned to indvidual video clips and the movement of the limb fin tuned to control the video playback.

The project includes an app to record perfromances with body tracking data into a timestamped xml file that can be replayed later. This allowed me to work with the performer in Canada whilst developing the project in the UK.
